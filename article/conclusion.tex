\section{Conclusion}
Here we conclude on the paper by summarizing what we did and what our results was. Furthermore we address how the problem could be further improved/investigated.

In this study we used just one range for OACL, but the method can easily be extended to use and optimize multiple ranges. That would likely increase the accuracy further, since different artifacts show up in different ranges. Each range adds to the dimensionality of the search space. Alternatively, a wavelet transform approach could be used for the removal step \citep{krishnaveni2006automatic}.

The filter bank can be improved by optimizing over a wider variety of sub-bands, e.g., by mixing sub-bands with differing spans such as [4-8] and [8-11]. This would increase the complexity of the input space.

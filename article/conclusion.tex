\section{Conclusion}
We considered the negative effect of ocular artifacts on classification of EEG 4-class motor imagery. As a possible solution to the problem, we presented a method for ocular artifact correction in multi class EEG data, based on the binary class ocular artifact correction by \citep{li2015ocular}. Furthermore, we showed that hyperparameters for the artifact correction method can be automatically tuned by application of Bayesian Optimization algorithm. By testing the ocular artifact correction on the BCI Competition dataset IV2a, we  we found that the best hyperparameters found after 200-300 iterations did not improve classification performance compared to classification without application of the ocular artifact correction method. We discuss that reasons for this include the problematically large optimization space over filtering parameters and that filtering parameters may not be generalizable over several trials.

Possible improvements for future work are adapting the logistic regression approach used by \citep{li2015ocular} for multi-class estimation of filtering parameters. Secondly, the detection and correction of the residual as a subprocess to the main artifact correction process.

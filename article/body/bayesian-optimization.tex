\subsection{Bayesian Optimization}\label{sec:bayesianoptimization}
Bayesian Optimization is a method for finding the extrema of expensive functions. In machine learning, we can see classification algorithms as functions to be optimized over their hyperparameters with respect to model accuracy, and thus Bayesian optimzation can be used to find the combination of hyperparameters that yields the highest performance in classification. \citet{snoek2012practical} shows that Bayesian Optimzation can be applied to existing problems to find even better parameters than the original authors, as well as outperform even experts at tuning machine learning algorithms.
